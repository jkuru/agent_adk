But SSE keeps a long-lived connection open — proxies timeout, load balancers kill idle streams, and TCP drops go undetected. The spec now recommends **Streamable HTTP**: each request is an independent `POST`, the server can respond with JSON or upgrade to a per-request SSE stream. For long-running agent tasks, `HTTP 202 Accepted` + polling is the most robust pattern — stateless, proxy-friendly, and recoverable. This notebook uses `stdio` (local subprocess), which sidesteps network concerns entirely.\n",

    "The term \"context extension\" captures what MCP really is — it **extends your LLM's capabilities** without retraining or re-prompting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without MCP, your LLM can only use tools that are:\n",

    "- Running in the same process\n",
    "- Stateless (no memory between calls)\n",

    "**1. Runtime Discovery**\n",

    "Same server, three ways to connect:\n",
    "- `stdio` — subprocess (what we use: simple, local)\n",
    "- `SSE` — server-sent events (network, streaming)\n",

    "# These agents are LIGHTWEIGHT — no vendor data, no memory,\n",
    "# no negotiation logic. They just call MCP tools on the server.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# ─── HOW THE LLM KNOWS WHICH FUNCTIONS TO CALL ─────────────\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Notice: we never list individual tools like FunctionTool(query_vendor_catalog).\n",
    "# Instead, each agent gets: tools=[McpToolset(connection_params=MCP_CONNECTION)]\n",
    "#\n",
    "# This is a CONNECTION, not a function list. Here's what happens at runtime\n",
    "# when Runner.run_async() starts for any of these agents:\n",
    "#\n",
    "#   1. ADK calls McpToolset.connect()\n",
    "#      → Spawns: python pike_place_server.py   (a child subprocess)\n",
    "#      → Transport: stdio pipe (JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdin/stdout)\n",
    "#\n",
    "#   2. ADK sends \"tools/list\" over the stdio pipe\n",
    "#      → This is the MCP discovery handshake — \"what tools do you have?\"\n",
    "#      → The LLM has NOT been called yet. This is framework plumbing.\n",
    "#\n",
    "#   3. The FastMCP server responds with 8 tool schemas:\n",

    "\n",
    "This notebook leaves **one gap intentionally open**: true Agent-to-Agent communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our negotiation is currently MCP — the client calls `negotiate_price`, the server applies deterministic math. To make it A2A:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Give vendors their own LLMs.** Each vendor stall becomes an autonomous agent that reasons about pricing strategy, inventory levels, and customer history.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Replace the tool call with a conversation.** Instead of `negotiate_price(offer=23.80)` → `{counter: 25.90}`, the buyer agent and vendor agent have a multi-turn dialogue:\n",
    "   - Buyer: \"I'll take 5lb at $23.80 — I'm a repeat customer\"\n",
    "   - Vendor: \"I remember you. $25 for loyalty, but only if you take 6lb\"\n",
    "   - Buyer: \"Deal at 5lb for $25?\"\n",
    "   - Vendor: \"Accepted.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use Agent Cards for discovery.** Each vendor publishes what it can do. The buyer's orchestrator discovers available vendors at runtime — no hardcoded vendor list.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's the natural next chapter. Same market, same vendors, same fish — different protocol layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The core lesson from this entire notebook:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> The pattern you wrap around an LLM determines how it thinks. Same Gemini 2.0 Flash model powers every agent here. But the Buyer reasons differently from the Inspector, which reasons differently from the Negotiator — because each has a different architecture, different tools, and different constraints. **Intelligence emerges from the system design, not just the model.**"
