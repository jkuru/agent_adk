    "\n",
    "**Pattern:** Separate planning from execution. A Planner creates a structured plan, an Executor runs one step at a time, and a Replanner adapts after each step.\n",

    "| Chapter | Pattern | What we learned | How Plan-and-Execute extends it |\n",
    "|---------|---------|-----------------|--------------------------------|\n",
    "| Ch 2 | Routing | Coordinator delegates to specialists | Planner *routes each step* to the right tool via `tool_hint` |\n",
    "| Ch 3 | Parallelization | Run agents concurrently | Plan steps are independent — future optimization can parallelize them |\n",
    "| Ch 5 | Tool Use | Single agent, single tool call | Executor uses **multiple tools** across a structured plan |\n",
    "| Ch 6 | Reflection | Adversarial reviewer corrects output | Replanner reviews progress and **revises the plan** if results change the task |\n",
    "| Ch 7 | Sequential | Fixed A→B→C pipeline | Plan-and-Execute is a **dynamic** sequence — the Replanner can rewrite remaining steps |\n",
    "| Ch 8a | ReAct | Inline reasoning, no upfront plan | Plan-and-Execute commits to a **visible, auditable plan** before executing |\n",

    "You're a **developer** who wants to research a technical topic, write runnable code that demonstrates the concept, execute it, and save everything to files. This is a **structured, multi-step task** — the kind that benefits from an upfront plan rather than ad-hoc exploration.\n",

    "2. **ExecutorAgent** — Runs one step at a time using tools (never plans ahead)\n",
    "3. **ReplannerAgent** — Reviews progress and decides: continue, replan, or done"

    "|-------|-----------|-------------------|------|\n",

    "| ExecutorAgent | Yes (4 tools) | Own session | Tactics only — completes one step |\n",
    "| ReplannerAgent | No | Own session | Review only — continue, replan, or done |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Patterns Composed\n",
    "\n",
    "| Pattern | Chapter | How it appears here |\n",
    "|---------|---------|--------------------|\n",
    "| Routing | Ch 2 | Planner routes each step to the right tool via `tool_hint` |\n",
    "| Parallelization | Ch 3 | Plan steps are independent — could be parallelized |\n",
    "| Tool Use | Ch 5 | Executor uses web_search, write_file, read_file, run_python |\n",
    "| Reflection | Ch 6 | Replanner reviews progress and revises the plan |\n",
    "| Sequential | Ch 7 | Plan → Execute → Replan is a sequential chain |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plan-and-Execute vs ReAct (Ch 8a)\n",
    "\n",
    "| Dimension | Plan-and-Execute | ReAct |\n",
    "|-----------|-----------------|-------|\n",
    "| Agents | 3 specialized | 1 general |\n",
    "| Plan | Explicit JSON (loggable, auditable) | Implicit in reasoning trace |\n",
    "| Adaptability | Replanner revises remaining steps | Every Thought can pivot |\n",
    "| Debugging | Trace across 3 agents | Single agent trace |\n",
    "| Parallelism | Steps are independent — can parallelize | Inherently serial |\n",
    "| Best for | **Long, structured tasks** | **Short, exploratory tasks** |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strict JSON output** from Planner/Replanner — easy to parse, inspect, and log. No ambiguity.\n",
    "- **Separate sessions** per agent — prevents state bleed. Context is passed explicitly via message text.\n",
    "- **Conservative Replanner** — only replans when results *change the task*. Prevents thrashing.\n",
    "- **Deterministic orchestrator** (Python class, not LLM) — the loop logic is reliable. Same principle as Ch 3/Ch 6's ParallelAgent."
