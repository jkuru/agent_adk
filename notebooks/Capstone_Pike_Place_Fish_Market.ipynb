    "| Pattern | Chapter | Where It Appeared |\n",
    "|---------|---------|------------------|\n",
    "| Routing | Ch 2 | Coordinator extracts fish type, routes to buyer specialist |\n",
    "| Parallelization | Ch 3 | `query_vendor_catalog` checks all 5 vendors |\n",
    "| Tool Use | Ch 5 | 7 tools: catalog, freshness, shipping, negotiate, learning, record, goals |\n",
    "| Reflection | Ch 6 | QualityInspector rejects low-freshness options |\n",
    "| Multi-Agent | Ch 7 | BuyerAgent, QualityInspector, GoalMonitor each with specialized roles |\n",
    "| Sequential | Ch 7 | Discovery → Inspection → Negotiation → Approval → Record |\n",
    "| AgentTool | Ch 7 | Negotiator uses vendor MCP as tool |\n",
    "| ReAct | Ch 8a | BuyerAgent explores vendors iteratively with reasoning between calls |\n",
    "| Plan-and-Execute | Ch 8b | Orchestrator replans when vendor fails (try next) |\n",
    "| Memory | New | PurchaseMemory stores history across runs |\n",
    "| Learning | New | LearningEngine finds best vendors from past data |\n",
    "| MCP Server | New | MockMCPVendorServer simulates vendor tool endpoints |\n",
    "| A2A Protocol | New | NegotiationProtocol: structured offer/counter/accept messages |\n",
    "| Goal Tracking | New | GoalTracker: ON_TRACK / AT_RISK / VIOLATED for budget, freshness, deadline |\n",

    "### Architecture Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "| Principle | How We Applied It |\n",
    "|-----------|------------------|\n",
    "| **Separation of Concerns** | Each agent has one job (buy, inspect, negotiate, monitor) |\n",
    "| **Deterministic Orchestration** | Python class drives the loop, not an LLM (Ch 8b lesson) |\n",
    "| **Graceful Degradation** | Exception → log → try backup → escalate to human |\n",
    "| **Explicit Protocols** | A2A negotiation, MCP tool calls, goal constraints — all structured |\n",
    "| **Learnable State** | Memory persists across runs, improving vendor selection |\n",
    "| **Transparent Reasoning** | Every agent call, tool use, and decision is logged and traceable |\n",
    "| **Mock for Reproducibility** | Deterministic vendor data (Ch 6 lesson) — same results every run |\n",
    "| **ADK Retry** | HttpRetryOptions on all agents (Ch 8b lesson) — no manual throttling |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook vs Production\n",
    "\n",
    "| Component | This Notebook | Production System |\n",
    "|-----------|--------------|------------------|\n",
    "| Vendor Catalog | Mock dict with fixed data | Live vendor APIs or databases |\n",
    "| MCP Server | In-process Python class | Actual vendor microservices |\n",
    "| Learning | Simple best-of averages | ML recommendation engine |\n",
    "| Goal Tracking | Python class with thresholds | Constraint solver (OR-Tools) |\n",
    "| Human Approval | Auto-approve flag | Webhook + email/SMS notification |\n",
    "| Memory | In-memory dict | PostgreSQL / Redis / data warehouse |\n",
    "| Exception Handling | Fallback to next vendor | Retry + alerting + on-call escalation |\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Core Lesson\n",
    "\n",
    "**The pattern you wrap around an LLM determines how it thinks.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Same Gemini 2.0 Flash model powers every agent in this notebook. But the Buyer reasons differently from the Inspector, which reasons differently from the Negotiator — because each is given a different architecture, different tools, and different constraints. Intelligence emerges from the system design, not just the model."
